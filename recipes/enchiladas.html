<h2>Delicious Vegan Enchiladas Anyone Can Make at Home</h2>
<p>These vegan enchiladas are packed with protein thanks to seasoned crumbled tofu.
   Simply preheat your oven, start chopping the veggies, prep the tofu and saute them all together with the seasonings.
</p>
<p>
  Next, coat your casserole dish with the enchilada sauce, roll small burritos with your sauteed mix and tortillas, and place them in your sauced casserole dish.
  Finally top the little burritos with more sauce and bake in the oven. These are great and only require a modest amount of prep. These are sure to satisfy even the most
  critical of carnivores.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound firm tofu <em>drained, patted dry, and cut into chunks</em></li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 TBL extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>2 medium jalapeno peppers <em>seeds and membranes removed, finely chopped</em></li>
  <li>1 medium red bell pepper cored, seeded, and diced</li>
  <li>1 small yellow onion (or 1/2 large onion) finely diced</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast<em>optional</em></li>
  <li>1 can black beans (15 ounces) <em>rinsed and drained</em></li>
  <li>1 packet frozen spinach (10 ounces) <em>thawed and pressed dry</em></li>
  <li>20 ounces red enchilada sauce (2 1/2 cups) <em></em>plus additional if you like your enchiladas really saucy*</em></li>
  <li>18 small corn tortillas <em>for larger enchiladas, you can use larger tortillas and fill them more generously</em></li>
  <li>For serving: your favorite mix of fresh cilantro avocado, diced green or red onion, lime wedges, radishes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly coat a large casserole dish with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Prepare the enchilada filling: Place the tofu in a food processor and puree for several minutes until smooth, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed. Sprinkle in the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. Pulse a few more times to mix well.</li>
  <li>Heat the 2 tablespoons oil in a deep skillet over medium. Once hot and shimmering, add the jalapeno, bell pepper, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften and begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tofu and nutritional yeast, if using, and continue cooking and stirring until the tofu is heated through and dries somewhat (it should look similar to scrambled eggs), about 5 minutes. Stir in the beans and thawed, pressed spinach. Stir, breaking up the spinach as you go. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
  <li>Spoon a thin layer of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Wrap the tortillas in damp paper or cloth towel and microwave for 30 seconds to make them more pliable. Scoop a 1/4-cup portion of filling into each tortilla (or whatever amount you desire), roll tightly, and place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon the remaining enchilada sauce over the top of the enchiladas. Lightly coat any exposed tortillas with a little nonstick spray or brush with olive oil so that they crisp nicely in the oven.</li>
  <li>Bake for 15 minutes, or until the sauce is hot and bubbly and the tortillas are golden. Serve with desired toppings.</li>
</ol>
